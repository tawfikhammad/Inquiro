# 🧠 Inquiro — Research Assistant API

**Inquiro** is an intelligent research assistant built with **FastAPI**, designed to simplify the management, summarization, and understanding of academic papers. With seamless integration of **LLMs** (Gemini) and **vector databases** (Qdrant), Inquiro allows you to:

- Upload and organize research papers by project
- Automatically generate intelligent summaries
- Chat with the collection of papers content for deeper understanding
- Translate or explain selection text in paper.
- Facilitate notes taking.
- Manage data with MongoDB and Qdrant
